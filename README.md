# Amenitiz Front-end Technical Challange üöÄ

## Introduction

The task is to create a wiki of Chess Grandmasters as defined by Chess.com. We are open to different layouts and styles.

### What we are looking for:
- This exercise should be done in React with Typescript. 
- We do not expect production-ready code. However, we do expect the candidate to point out sub-optimal compromises taken to complete the task

üìñ Documentation for chess.com's API can be found here: https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api#pubapi-endpoint-games-archive

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Step 1: List the Grandmasters

Using the chess.com API, create a page that lists all the Grandmasters.

API endpoint: https://api.chess.com/pub/titled/GM

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Step 2: Grandmaster profile page

Extend the page that you created for the previous step so that if you click on a listed grandmaster, it should take you to a profile page displaying the information from the player endpoint.

API endpoint for player: [https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}](https://api.chess.com/pub/player/john)

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Step 3: Add Grandmaster summary

On the profile page for a grandmaster that you created in step 2, add a clock that displays the amount of time since they were last online. The time since the user was active should be displayed as HH:MM:SS, and it should update every second.

## üîç Personal Notes and Potential Improvements

I've completed the challenge as requested, but I would like to highlight several areas where the application could be enhanced:

- **State Management**: Implementing Redux to store the list of grandmasters would prevent unnecessary API calls when navigating back to the listing page.
- **Search Functionality**: Adding a search feature would improve user experience when looking for specific grandmasters.
- **Enhanced Pagination**: A more interactive pagination system could make navigating through the large list of grandmasters more efficient.
- **Loading States**: Better loading states and error handling throughout the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Further optimizations for different screen sizes.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed profiles.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Code splitting and lazy loading for better initial load times.

These improvements would significantly enhance the user experience and overall application performance, but were beyond the scope of the initial challenge requirements.
